<h3 align="center">Twixera</h3>
<p align="center">The experience you fell in love with on Mixer, now on Twitch!</p>

## Overview

Twixera (former Mixera) aims to enhance your experience on twitch.tv!<br/>
Twixera focuses on adding new features and interactions to the Twitch streaming platform in the forms of:

-   Chat avatars.
-   Hide chat badges to make the chat more clutter free.
-   New dark theme.
-   Hide Prime button.
-   New "/me" style.
-   And much more to come!

## How to use

-   Install ( [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twixera/gefbnbbmfoakmbblphigemkiekfelahe) | [FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/twixera/?src=recommended) ) and visit twitch.tv to start using it.
-   To edit the settings, click on the Twixera icon ( the X ) in the top right of the website where you'll find the prime icon and notifications icon.

## Contribution

Generally not looking for contributions since this is more of a personal project, but I'm open for suggestions and fixes!

## Notice
There's still a lot of old files and code that needs to be removed after the switch to Twitch. I'll eventually get that sorted out once I get back to this project!
